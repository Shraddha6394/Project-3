An android app that helps automate the various tasks that are carried out by mess management and attendees! 🎉<br>
Each student can create his/her own profile by registering on the app using an email id and room number. The mess management provides the list of upcoming meals that are shown on student’s feeds.<br>
Features of Messsy-<br>
🌟 Record future absence - The attendee can inform the management about their future absence through this so that there won’t be any wastage of food and the money can be compensated. <br>
🌟 Notice - This section contains notices regarding mess timing, changes in the menu, etc.<br>
🌟 Manage Payments - All details of the payments done or due will be shown in this section.<br>
🌟 Vote for menu change - Addition or removal of any item from breakfast, lunch, or dinner can be voted here.<br>
🌟 Complaint section - If any attendee faces any problems then he/she can inform the management. They can complain about their issue with the description and also upload images (if any).<br>
🌟 e-Coupon - Just scan the QR code and use the e-Coupons available.<br>
